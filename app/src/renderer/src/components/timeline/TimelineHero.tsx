 * The Today hero: the next thing, the day drawn, and what will not fit.
 *
 * This replaced an earlier hero that said the same thing as a sentence — "5h20m due
 * today · 3h10m free · over by 2h10m". That version was rejected, and the reason is the
 * whole design of this card: a total tells you that you are over, but not *which* task is
 * the one that is not going to happen. Seeing the gaps, and seeing three named tasks with
 * nowhere to go, is a decision. A number is only a mood.
 *
 * Overcommitment is gold here and nowhere near red — red is reserved for destroying
 * something, and being over is information.
