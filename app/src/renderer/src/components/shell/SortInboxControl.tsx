/**
 * Runs `/sort-inbox` — the same skill, the same scripts — from inside the app.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does not do, each learned by actually running it:
 *
 *   · It does not show a spinner. A run takes 40–115 seconds, and a spinner that long
 *     reads as a hang, so the current step is named and the run can be stopped.
 *   · It does not report success when the run was partial. A denied tool means captures
 *     went unexamined, and a green check over that is a lie the user cannot catch.
 *   · It does not claim counts the model asserted. `filed` and `needsYou` are counted
 *     from the Inbox itself, before and after.
